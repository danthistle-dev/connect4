To run app locally:
  In src/server directory:
    $ node index.js
  Then, in a new terminal inside the root directory:
    $ npm start

This app was created using react, mongodb and express.

I have made the mistake of leaving deployment until the due day. I have attempted to host on turing and heroku with no luck.

I will attempt to host it after the due date but it is not available to include in this readme.

I will send an email with a link to Will when I have figured out the hosting.
